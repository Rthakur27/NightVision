Night Vision Enhancement Project
Welcome to the Night Vision Enhancement Project! This project is designed to improve the visibility and quality of images captured in low-light conditions. Whether you're dealing with surveillance footage or night photography, these image enhancement techniques will aid in making dark images more visually comprehensible.

Project Overview
In this project, we have implemented several image processing techniques to enhance low-light images. The main functionalities include:

Night Vision Effect: Applying a night vision effect to input images, enhancing brightness, and adding a green overlay.

Hybrid Enhancement: Combining spatial and frequency domain enhancements using Fourier transform and a high-pass filter.

Dualistic Histogram Equalization: Implementing dualistic histogram equalization for contrast enhancement.

Illumination Channel Analysis: Analyzing the dark and bright channels of an image to understand illumination characteristics.

Project Structure
The project directory is structured as follows:

night vision dataset/: Contains the dataset of images captured in low-light conditions.

night_vision_effect.py: Applies a night vision effect to input images.

hybrid_enhancement.py: Combines spatial and frequency domain enhancements.

dualistic_histogram_equalization.py: Implements dualistic histogram equalization.

illumination_channel_analysis.py: Analyzes the dark and bright channels of an image.

README.md: This file, providing an overview, instructions, and details about the project.

Results
The results of each enhancement technique, along with visualizations, can be found in the respective output directories.
